# Welcome to Wavemaker V2

This is the Open Source version I'm releasing into the wild. It's built using HTML/CSS/jQuery
It was not planned but sorta-kinda-happened as the code will show. Which is why version 3 up is a total rebuild!
It will run on pretty much any device as well as on the web, and you can locally install on any desktop.

# Run this Locally

**Totally possible - it will run as an offline app on any computer that uses  Google Chrome**
Download the Zip file and unpack it on your computer where ever you want

*You will need Google Chrome for these instructions, but opera, chromium and other blink based browsers should be similar.*

Enable Developer mode by going to  : [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
Top right hand corner flick the toggle switch
A button should appear with "Load Unpacked Extension"
Press this and point it at the folder with Wavemaker in
Then visit [chrome://apps/](chrome://apps/) and you should see the icon there.

Enjoy.

## For developers

First of all - Sorry, you guys know how it is when something that's a playabout experiment gets too detailed. Code could use a cleanup, and comments. 

That said - it works, it's a not ideal proof of concept that got the idea off the ground.

You will only need HTML/CSS/JS/jQuery knowledge

The .wmProj file is just JSON renamed so it could be found easily in a Google Drive search (not needed for the extension version)

Feel free to get in there and fix tidy or even add features :)
